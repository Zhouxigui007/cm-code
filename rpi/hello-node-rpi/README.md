# hello-node-rpi

These exercises provide a learning pathway for understanding how to use Node.js on a Raspberry Pi device to build interactive and connected devices. These exercises do not make use of the Express Framework and assume some familiarity with running Node.js applications on a local machine (macOS) as shown in [hello-node](https://github.com/rjduran/cm-code/tree/master/node/hello-node).
